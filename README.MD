# MediChat-LLM

## Overview

MediChat-LLM is an advanced chatbot designed specifically for medical professionals and enthusiasts. Utilizing state-of-the-art language models, MediChat-LLM can provide insightful, accurate, and contextually relevant responses to medical inquiries. This project is built to leverage the power of large language models, particularly the Llama 2 model, to create an intelligent assistant that can access and utilize a custom knowledge base derived from medical literature.
